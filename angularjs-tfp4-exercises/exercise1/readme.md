In this exercise, this application consists of a simple main view component, which contains a list of details about Batman characters. While this component is configured properly in index.js, it is not currently being displayed.

1. Ensure that the component's data model is being read correctly into its template. Go to mainView.html,and complete the listed TODO's.  Note that you still won't see anything rendered on the screen at this point.

2. The component is defined, but not used anywhere. Declare it within the main HTML by completing the TODO in index.html. Once done, you should see the results within the browser.
